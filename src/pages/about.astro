        I unknowingly started my web development journey writing custom CSS for Reddit communities back in 2015. At the
        time, I thought it was their own random way of styling their pages. Around that time I also got into some of my
        hobbies I still enjoy today. I got my first computer and started getting into PC gaming, sim racing, graphic
        design, and some very light programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continued these hobbies and interests through high school and decided to study Comupter Science due to nerdy
        nature of my hobbies. Makes sense, right? I ended up changing my major to Computer Engineering later thinking I
        would enjoy more of a focus on hardware.

        Soon after that I had decided to take an Intro to Web Development class to fill in some credits. I loved it so much
        that I dropped all of my other classes and changed my major to Software Engineering to focus completely on web 
        development for the rest of my time in college. It was the perfect balance of my love for design and programming.
